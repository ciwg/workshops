From the perspective of Pygame's classes and functions, the key components include:

1. **pygame.Surface:**
   This is one of the main classes in Pygame. A surface is like a blank canvas on which you can draw lines, shapes, and images. Each surface has a specific width and height.

2. **pygame.Rect:**
   This class represents a rectangular area in pixels. It is generally used to keep track of the bounding box of a sprite (game object).

3. **pygame.event:**
   This is not a class but a module that allows you to handle events. Pygame's event system can handle multiple types of events including mouse clicks, keyboard input, and collision between sprites.

4. **pygame.display:**
   This module includes functions that allow you to work with the display window. You can use it to create the display window, change its size, and update its contents.

5. **pygame.draw:**
   This module includes functions that allow you to draw shapes (like rectangles, circles, and polygons) onto a surface.

Functions like `pygame.display.set_mode()` creates a game window, `pygame.display.update()` or `pygame.display.flip()` refreshes the game screen, `pygame.event.get()` returns a list of all of the events that have happened since the last time this function was called, and `pygame.quit()` to properly close the Pygame window when you are done with it.

In addition to these, there are classes like pygame.sprite.Sprite for creating game objects and the module pygame.image for loading and displaying images. Pygame.mixer and pygame.music for add sounds and music to your game, and pygame.clock for controlling the frame rate.
