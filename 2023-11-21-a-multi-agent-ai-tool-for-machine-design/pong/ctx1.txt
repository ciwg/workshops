Here's an improved version of your code. The improved code includes continuous paddle control with key press, it controls ball speed, adds collision detection with the paddles and scoring mechanism.

from structure.txt:
This code will run a basic Pong game where the ball bounces off the top and bottom of the screen and the left and right ends. You will need to add control mechanism for the paddles, collision detection between the paddles and the ball, and scoring for a complete game.

This code creates a simple pong game where a ball bounces off the paddles.
