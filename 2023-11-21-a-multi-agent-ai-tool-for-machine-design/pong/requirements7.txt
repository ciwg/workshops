Here are the requirements based off the provided Python code for the Pong game:

1. The game development platform, Pygame, is used to develop the Pong game. Hence, Pygame has to be installed.
2. The game supports two players. Player 1 uses 'w' and 's' keys to move their paddle up and down while, Player 2 uses 'UP' and 'DOWN' keys.
3. The dimensions of the pong game screen is 600x400 pixels.
4. The game has a specified constant for the Paddle and Ball sizes; a ball radius of 20 pixels, paddle width of 15 pixels and a paddle height of 80 pixels.
5. The game has a set speed for the paddles and the ball. The paddle moves at a speed of 4 pixels per frame, and the ball moves at a speed of 2 pixels per frame. 
6. The ball changes direction when it hits a paddle or the top and bottom edges of the game screen.
7. The paddle moves vertically and is restricted by the top and bottom edge of the game screen.
8. Each player gains a point when the opponent misses the ball. The ball resets to the center of the screen after each point scored.
9. The game runs at 60 frames per second, ensuring constant speed on all machines it runs on.
10. The game objects and scoring information are rendered at every frame; there is immediate feedback after each action.
11. The game ends when the user closes the application window.
12. A quit option is in place, closing the application when activated. 
13. The game is fully functional, including the main game loop, movement controls for paddles, ball speed and direction, collision detection, scoring system and rendering of the game objects.
14. The color scheme is black and white: the game background is black, and the game objects (ball and paddles) are white.
