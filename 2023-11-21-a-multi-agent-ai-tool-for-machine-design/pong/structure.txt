Creating a pong game with Pygame includes initiating the game, creating the game objects (paddles and ball) and a game loop that controls how the game will run. Below is a basic outline of the game:

```python
import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

# Initiate Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up some constants
WIDTH = 600
HEIGHT = 400
BALL_RADIUS = 20
PADDLE_WIDTH = 15
PADDLE_HEIGHT = 80

WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

# Create the ball and paddles 
ball = pygame.Rect(WIDTH // 2, HEIGHT // 2, BALL_RADIUS, BALL_RADIUS)
paddle1 = pygame.Rect(PADDLE_WIDTH, HEIGHT // 2, PADDLE_WIDTH, PADDLE_HEIGHT)
paddle2 = pygame.Rect(WIDTH - (2 * PADDLE_WIDTH), HEIGHT // 2, PADDLE_WIDTH, PADDLE_HEIGHT)

# Control the initial direction the ball will travel in
ball_dx = 1
ball_dy = 1

# Create the game window
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == QUIT:
            running = False
       
    # Add Continuous paddle controls here 
   
    # Update Ball Movement
    ball.left += ball_dx
    ball.top += ball_dy

    if ball.left <= 0 or ball.right >= WIDTH:
        ball_dx *= -1
    if ball.top <= 0 or ball.bottom >= HEIGHT:
        ball_dy *= -1

    # Update Game Display
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    for entity in [ball, paddle1, paddle2]:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, WHITE, entity)

    pygame.display.flip()
    pygame.time.delay(30)

pygame.quit()
```

This code will run a basic Pong game where the ball bounces off the top and bottom of the screen and the left and right ends. You will need to add control mechanism for the paddles, collision detection between the paddles and the ball, and scoring for a complete game.
