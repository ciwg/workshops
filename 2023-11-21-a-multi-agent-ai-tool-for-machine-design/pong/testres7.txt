Yes, the provided Python code satisfies all the provided requirements of the Pong game. 

1. The game uses Pygame for development.
2. There are two players and they can control their paddle. Player 1 uses the 'w' and 's' keys while Player 2 uses the 'UP' and 'DOWN' keys.
3. The screen dimension of the game is 600x400 pixels. 
4. The paddle and ball dimensions are given by constants.
5. The paddle and ball both move at set speed, paddle moves at 4 pixels per frame and ball moves at 2 pixels per frame.
6. The ball does change direction when it hits the paddle or the top and bottom edges of the game screen.
7. The paddle's motion is only vertical and is restricted with the top and bottom edges of the game screen.
8. Scoring is implemented as required. Each time a player misses the ball, the opposition gets a point, and the ball resets to the center.
9. The game runs at 60 FPS.
10. The game objects and score updates are rendered at every frame for immediate feedback.
11. The game ends only when the user closes it.
12. The game indeed allows quitting the game by closing the application window.
13. All mentioned functionality such as the main game loop, movement controls for paddles, ball speed, collision detection, scoring system, object rendering are present.
14. The color scheme is met, the game is in black and white, with the background being black and the game objects (paddles and ball) are white.  

Therefore, all requirements are satisfied by the provided code.
