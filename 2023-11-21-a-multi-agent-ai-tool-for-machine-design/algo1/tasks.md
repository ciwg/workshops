# Tasks:

## User Stories:

### For User Story: "As a developer, I want a bash script that will help me evolve code using the grok msg ai tool"

1. Evaluate the current capability of the Grok msg AI tool for code evolution.
2. Design a bash scripting sequence to implement the tool for modification within a coding environment.
3. Write code for integrating the Grok msg AI tool within a bash script.
4. Test the functionality of the script within a development environment.

### For User Story: "As a user, I do not want the user consent step, and I will always install the 'grok' command before running the script"

1. Analyze the current user consent step to understand its functionality and implications for the user.
2. Identify a way to bypass or remove the consent step from the 'grok' command software installation process.
3. Modify the script to exclude the user consent step during installation.
4. Test the edited script for installation, ensuring 'grok' command is installed successfully without needing user consent.

## Bugs

Since you've not provided any specific code, environment, or user stories experiencing bugs, I cannot create exact tasks for debugging. However, here's a generic debugging workflow:

1. Replicate the issue: Get a firm understanding of how and when the bug manifests.
2. Isolate the bug: Identify the specific part of the code or process where the bug occurs.
3. Identify the root cause: Understand why the bug is happening and identify the involved parameters.
4. Develop a fix for the bug: Modify the code or process to resolve the issue.
5. Test the fix: Implement the fix in an isolated environment and validate if it truly resolves the issue.
6. Implement the fix: Integrate the fix into the main project.
7. Monitor for recurrence: Keep an eye on the system to ensure the bug does not reappear.
