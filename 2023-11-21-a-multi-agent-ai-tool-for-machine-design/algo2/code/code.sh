Given the tasks you've explained, keeping the existing code base in mind is not provided. However, I'll write the bash script based on the task descriptions you've provided.

Here's the code.sh file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Task 1: Bash script development
# This script will use the 'grok msg' AI tool for code evolution

# Task 2: Incorporate 'grok' command awareness
# The script will recognize and use the 'grok' command and its 'msg' subcommand.

while true
do
    # read the message from the user
    read -p "Enter the message: " message

    # Task 3: Eliminate consent step in loop
    # The loop will no longer ask for user consent before continuing

    # Task 4: Remove 'grok' command check in script
    # We will not check whether 'grok' command exists before its execution
  
    grok msg $message
done
```

Save this into a file named `code.sh`. Then you can run it by typing `bash code.sh` in the terminal. Ensure ‘grok’ command is installed in your environment otherwise, script will provide an error.

code.sh
```
#!/bin/bash 

set -x

touch code/stories.md

while true
do
    inotifywait -r -e modify code/*
    sleep 1
    make -C code
done
```
