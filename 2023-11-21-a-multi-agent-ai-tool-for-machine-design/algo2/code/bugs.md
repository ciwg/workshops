- as a developer i want a bash script that will help me evolve code
  using the grok msg ai tool
- as a developer, i understand that the 'grok' command exists, and has
  a 'msg' subcommand that will do the job
- as a user, i do not want a consent step in the loop
- as a user, i do not want the script to check for the 'grok' command before running
  the script
