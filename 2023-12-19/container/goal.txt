I want to use 'grok chat' with the gpt-4 model to test the ability to
write and test code in a container.  You will create a Dockerfile for
the container, a start.sh that builds and starts the container, and a
cycle.sh that will be run for each iteration of writing and testing
code.  List all of your output files in manifest.txt.  If you need
more files to be created, list them in manifest.txt.
