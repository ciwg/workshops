# Design Document

This document outlines the design of a CDEV/CI/CD system that employs 'grok chat' and the GPT-4 model. The system is designed to streamline continuous development, integration, and deployment (CDEV/CI/CD) within a Docker container environment and provides an option for deployment to production.

## Role of Grokker Agent in CDEV/CI/CD

The 'grok' agent plays a fundamental role in this system:

1. For simulated remote users, each in their own Docker container, 'grok' works as middleware managing version control, automated test case execution, application building, and deployment readiness.

2. In a mixed environment with simulated users in containers and real remote users, 'grok' ensures a consistent development environment, handling code integration from multiple users, managing automated build and tests, and guaranteeing a smooth transition from development to production.

3. In an environment consisting of only real remote users, 'grok' oversees code integration and prepares the application for release, thus accelerating feedback for new changes and facilitating quicker detection and resolution of issues.

## Docker Management

'Grok' manages Docker operations, providing direct control over the Docker environment and flexibility in setting up and managing containers - an essential facet for intricate workflows that utilize the "grok group" command. To better integrate with Docker, the system relies on Docker's Go SDK for programmatic control over Docker operations, ensuring structured data collection, nuanced response handling, and a consistent interface irrespective of Docker's version.

## Container Initialization Algorithm

The 'grok' agent would utilize an algorithm to start all of the Docker containers. This algorithm operates on a single configuration file, specifying agents, their branch names, and agent backends (AI, humans, test suite, etc.):

1. Starting by reading the configuration file, detailing the list of agents, their branch names, and agent backends.

2. Initiating a loop where it starts each agent's Docker container according to the specified configuration.

3. Upon successfully initiating all the containers, the algorithm concludes.

## Internal Agent Algorithm

The agent running within the Docker container follows a specific loop as outlined in the provided internal.dot diagram:

1. Start

2. Fetch the latest code.

3. Check if a new commit has been detected.

4. If a new commit is detected, proceed to merge and improve code. If not, return to fetching the latest code.

5. Run tests on the updated code. 

6. Check if there are any errors in the tests. 

7. If there are no errors, commit code changes and proceed back to fetching the latest code. If errors are detected, return to the 'Merge and Improve' stage.

All states are preservable via git commits following any significant transaction: ensuring continuity even if the Docker container abruptly stops or reboots.

## Continuity and Error Handling

The agent is built to robustly handle errors and continue operations when possible. Detection of errors such as fetching new changes, building errors, or failing tests prompts the agent to log the error with relevant details and attempt to proceed with the rest of the tests or processes. This approach allows for continuous operations during sporadic issues while maintaining a detailed log for debugging purposes.

## Communication and Collaboration

Primarily, the agent communicates with the exterior world via changes committed to the repository. These changes account for the agent's contributions shared with other collaborating agents and developers, along with any changes in the project state, marked as significant by the agent. Such changes are designed to be non-blocking and causality-preserving, allowing asynchronous reactions by other agents or developers without disrupting their workflow.

Moreover, the agent responds to communication originating from other agents or systems outside of its container, rerunning tests in response to a human agent manually triggering a re-run of tests via a command in the chat interface.

## Open Questions and Considerations

1. Is it necessary to list human agents in the configuration file, or can the system scan for new commits on all branches?

   Suggestion: Rather than listing human agents in the configuration file, the system could potentially scan for new commits on all branches to ensure all updates made by human agents, including those made on new branches, are captured. This approach might introduce complexity but could improve overall system responsiveness and flexibility.

2. How to handle state across multiple cycles in a Docker container?

   Suggestion: Implementation of a strategy making a Git commit after every significant transaction can preserve the state even if a container crashes or restarts.

3. How to integrate real, remote users with AI-backed agents in the same environment and manage their interactions?

   Suggestion: A user-and-role management system could be implemented where git branches serve as user identifiers, thus effectively managing interactions based on users' roles and permissions.
